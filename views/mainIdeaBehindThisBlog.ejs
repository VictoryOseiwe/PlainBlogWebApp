    <h1>MAIN IDEA BEHIND THIS PLAIN BLOG</h1>
<p>
    <li>
        The main idea behind this plain blog web app is to let users post.
        <ul>
            So for ever post the user create it will reflect on the homepage
        </ul>
        This is a plain web app running from my laptop
        <ul>
            if a user creates i gets store in an array i.e(a form of container where i can see the stuffs i 
            dropped in) since am not using a database
        </ul>
    </li>

<h2>WHY DO WE DEVELOPERS USE LOREM IPSUM</h2>
    <P>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will
        be distracted by the readable content of a page when 
        looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that
        it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed 
        to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
        Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
        default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
        their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
        sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
